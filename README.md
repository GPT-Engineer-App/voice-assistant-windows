# voice-assistant-windows

I want you to create a voice assistant project that can be used on Windows using Python and PyQT5. The details of the project are as follows. The GUI design should be simple and elegant.

Features to be included in the project
- Face Recognition
- Voice Recognition
- Open Music (Spotify, Apple Music, YouTube Music)
- Open Video (YouTube)
- Doing Research (Wikipedia)
- Set Reminder and Alarm
- Read news from Turkey using Google News RSS 
- Running Windows applications
- Ability to enable and disable features such as Bluetooth, WiFi
- There will be a sound wave in the center of the GUI. It will fluctuate according to the intensity of the speaker's voice. When the person starts talking, the sound wave will be green, when they stop talking it will be invisible.
